Creating an Income Expense Calculator that allows users to add, edit, and delete income and expense entries involves building a simple web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The Income-Expense Calculator project is a small web-based application that allows users to track their finances. It enables users to add, edit, and delete entries related to income and expenses. Additionally, it provides a summary of their financial status by calculating the total income, total expenses, and the resulting balance (income - expenses).
The application implements the CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript:

Create: Users can add new income or expense entries.
Read: The application displays the list of added entries (both income and expenses).
Update: Users can edit any previously added entry.
Delete: Users can remove any entry they no longer need.

Core Concepts:
HTML: Structure of the app, including input forms, buttons, and a display area for financial entries.
CSS: Styling the interface for better user experience and aesthetics.
JavaScript: Handles the logic for CRUD operations, calculations, and updates to the UI.
Here's a simplified explanation of how it works:

User Input: The user enters details like the amount and description of an income/expense in a form.

CRUD Operations: The application allows the user to add these details to a list, update existing entries, or delete them as needed.

Overview: The app calculates and shows total income, total expenses, and the current balance dynamically as new entries are added or deleted.

Add Transaction: The user can input the description and amount of income or expense. Positive amounts are considered income, and negative amounts are expenses.

Edit Transaction: By clicking "Edit", the transaction will be loaded back into the input fields for modification.

Delete Transaction: Users can remove any transaction using the "Delete" button.

Overview: Displays the current balance, total income, and total expenses, updating dynamically as transactions change.

Features:
Add Entry: Users can add income or expense entries by entering a description and amount.
Edit Entry: Users can edit an existing entry by clicking the "Edit" button.
Delete Entry: Users can delete an entry by clicking the "Delete" button.
Balance Calculation: The total balance is automatically calculated based on the entries.
This project provides a basic implementation of an income and expense calculator using CRUD operations. It can be further extended with features like data persistence using local storage, advanced filtering options, and more detailed analytics.
